Text Input with Dynamic Color Change

This is a simple React application that allows users to enter text in a text field, and the entered text is displayed below in real-time. Users can also choose a color from a color picker to dynamically change the color of the displayed text.

Features

	•	Text Input: Users can type any text, which will be displayed below as they type.
	•	Color Picker: Users can select a color from a color input tool, which will immediately change the text color.
	•	Live Preview: As the user types and selects a color, the text updates dynamically below.

Technologies Used

	•	React: For building the user interface with dynamic state management using React’s useState hook.
	•	CSS: Basic styling to structure and present the elements on the page.
	•	HTML: To create the basic form elements (input field and color picker).

How It Works

	1.	Users type in the input field.
	2.	The text is displayed below the input in real-time.
	3.	The color of the displayed text changes based on the selected color from the color picker.
